# DECISIONS.md — Wallora

Decisions made during autonomous execution (date, decision, why).

## 2026-07-05

**Reddit API key acquisition changed (Responsible Builder Policy)**: As of 2025-11-11 Reddit
ended self-service API keys. Filling the app form at reddit.com/prefs/apps no longer instantly
creates an app — access must be requested via Reddit's Developer Support form
(support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=14868593862164) and approved (~7 days).
Documented this in README ("API key setup") and the in-app Reddit client-ID hint string, and
corrected the README's stale "Reddit — no key required" claim (Reddit has always needed a client
ID; now it also needs approval). No code change: the existing bring-your-own client-ID model
(Settings → Sources → Reddit client ID) is already the correct design — Reddit forbids shipping a
shared/hardcoded key, and Wallora uses userless installed-app OAuth (client ID only, no secret).

## 2026-06-13

**JDK**: Eclipse Temurin 17.0.13 LTS (OpenJDK 17) installed to ~/.local/jdk17.
Chose JDK 17 over 21 for broadest AGP 8.x compatibility; Gradle 8.9 supports both
but some AGP versions warn on 21 with certain flags. JDK 17 is the safe default.

**Reddit datacenter block**: Reddit returns HTTP 403 from this server's IP address.
This affects build-time network tests only — the app itself runs on-device where
Reddit is accessible. Reddit source implemented and tested against committed JSON
fixtures; runtime is fail-soft (per-source failure never blanks the grid).

**Paging architecture**: Used a custom fan-out PagingSource (not RemoteMediator+Room)
for multi-source round-robin interleave. Room is used as a side TTL page cache
(lookup by key), not as the Paging 3 backing store. This avoids the complexity of
RemoteMediator coordinating N heterogeneous sources and gives direct control over
interleaving and dedup logic.

**Rotation pre-fetch**: TASKS.md P3-d mentions pre-fetching the next wallpaper on Wi-Fi
as a background warm-up. Deferred from P3-d implementation — true pre-fetch requires an
on-device persistent image cache beyond OkHttp's in-memory cache (e.g., writing to a
temp File, then using that file on next apply). The rotation apply itself is already
fast once the full-res URL is known. Pre-fetch will be revisited in Phase 6 performance
pass if needed; the mechanism (kick off OkHttp download, store to cacheDir file) is
straightforward to add then.

**Splash screen theme parent**: `Theme.Wallora` now extends `Theme.SplashScreen` (from
`core-splashscreen 1.0.1`) and declares `postSplashScreenTheme = Theme.Wallora.Main`.
`MainActivity.installSplashScreen()` must be called before `super.onCreate()` to honour
the splash. The base `Theme.Wallora.Main` parent remains
`android:Theme.Material.Light.NoActionBar`; Compose handles all runtime theming via
`WalloraTheme` (dynamic color + dark mode).

**Coil memory cache type**: `MemoryCache.Builder.maxSizeBytes()` in Coil 2.7.0 takes
`Int`, not `Long`. Memory cache sized at 20% of maxMemory(), coerced to [32 MB, 256 MB]
then cast to Int. Disk cache uses `Long` (DiskCache.Builder.maxSizeBytes accepts Long)
set to 250 MB.

**Non-RenderScript blur**: `ImageAdjustments.applyStackBlur()` uses a three-pass
downscale → iterative box blur → upscale algorithm. No `android.renderscript` or
`androidx.renderscript` dependency — fully compatible with minSdk 31 without the
deprecated RenderScript Intrinsics Replacement Toolkit.

## 2026-06-13 (round 2 — post-install fixes)

**Root cause A1 — black detail preview (GPU max-texture-size overflow)**:
`WalloraApp.kt` global `ImageLoader` defaults to `allowHardware=true`. Full-res originals
from Wallhaven (5K+), Pexels (`src.original`), and Unsplash (`urls.full`) routinely exceed
the Pixel 6 Pro GPU max texture size (≈4096–8192px). A HARDWARE `Bitmap` that large cannot
be uploaded by Compose's `RecordingCanvas` → renders black. Thumbnails (server-resized to
≤1280px) stay under the limit → render fine. Fix: `DetailScreen.kt` `ImageRequest` now
uses `.allowHardware(false)` (software bitmap, always drawable regardless of size) and
`.size(displayW, displayH)` so Coil's `inSampleSize` downsamples before decode. Visible
error overlay added — load failure never shows a silent black box. Hardware bitmaps kept
for the grid (thumbs are always small).

UltraHDR/Display-P3 on Android 17 QPR Beta 3 is a contributing factor: gainmap images
decoded without sRGB pinning can also render incorrectly. `allowHardware(false)` sidesteps
both issues for the detail preview path.

**Root cause A2-live — live engine permanently black (zero callers on loadBitmap)**:
`WalloraWallpaperService.WalloraEngine.loadBitmap()` had zero callers. `currentBitmap`
started null; `renderOnCanvas` painted `Color.BLACK` whenever null. `NextWallpaperUseCase`
always routed through `WallpaperManager.setBitmap` (static apply), never signalling the
engine. Fix: added `current_wallpaper_full_url` + `_thumb_url` keys to `SettingsRepository`;
`NextWallpaperUseCase` persists the picked wallpaper on every rotation; in live-wallpaper
mode avoids `setBitmap(FLAG_SYSTEM)` (which would deactivate the live wallpaper). The engine
observes `currentWallpaperUrls` Flow and calls `loadWallpaperFromUrl()` → `loadBitmap()`.
On first surface ready with no persisted URL, kicks `nextWallpaperUseCase` once.

**Root cause E1 — parallax never moved**: `setOffsetNotificationsEnabled(true)` was never
called in `Engine.onCreate`, so the launcher never delivered xOffset values. Bitmap was
never made over-wide. Fix: added `setOffsetNotificationsEnabled(true)` in `onCreate`;
`loadWallpaperFromUrl` decodes at `ParallaxMath.PARALLAX_SCALE` (1.3×) × `surfaceWidth`.
`ParallaxMath.clampTranslateX` applied to avoid edge gaps. DEBUG-gated offset logging added.

**compileSdk/targetSdk kept at 35**: FIXES.md suggested bumping for Android 17 QPR Beta 3.
The black-image bugs are decode-flag issues, not SDK-gated. Bumping compileSdk past 35 would
require an AGP upgrade (8.5.2 → 8.6+/8.7+) with no device to validate runtime behaviour
changes. Decision: stay at 35, fix the actual root causes. Revisit if a specific API ≥36
is required.

**D1 — category persistence**: `HomeViewModel.selectedCategories` was a transient
`MutableStateFlow(emptySet())` — not persisted. Wired to the EXISTING
`SettingsRepository.selectedCategories` DataStore flow (already used by `SettingsViewModel`).
Single source of truth; survives navigation and process death.

**B1 — double-tap default changed to OFF**: Most launchers (Nova, Lawnchair, etc.) consume
double-tap on the home screen for their own gesture (e.g. lock screen, app drawer). Leaving
double-tap ON causes confusion. Default changed from `?: true` to `?: false`. Alternative
provided: `NextWallpaperActivity` trampoline (exported, `com.wallora.app.action.NEXT_WALLPAPER`)
bindable as a Nova gesture shortcut or Tasker action; static shortcut in `shortcuts.xml`.

**C1 — widget applies in-place**: Widget previously launched `MainActivity` on tap.
Changed to `actionRunCallback<NextWallpaperAction>()`. `NextWallpaperAction` is a Glance
`ActionCallback` that retrieves `NextWallpaperUseCase` via `EntryPointAccessors` (Glance
callbacks are not Hilt-injected). App-name label retained as a way to open the app.

**F1 — Baseline Profile deferred**: Generating a Baseline Profile requires running
`BaselineProfileRule` or `MacrobenchmarkRule` on a real device or managed emulator. Neither
is available in this environment (CLAUDE.md: "no device/emulator attached"). Deferred.
WallpaperGrid already uses stable keys, hardware bitmaps for thumbs, and correctly-sized
requests. `@Stable` added to `Wallpaper` data class (List<String> tags field prevents
automatic inference). Coil cache (250MB disk, 20% heap) left unchanged.

**Manual check list for HDR/large-image decode (A3)**:
On device: open detail screen for a Wallhaven full-res image (5K+). Verify image renders
(not black). Check Logcat tag `WalloraDetail` for any `onError` entries. Test with an
UltraHDR image (Pixel 6 Pro native HDR camera shot uploaded to Pexels/Unsplash). Verify
live wallpaper engine shows the image (not black) after setting as live wallpaper and
rotating once. Enable Nova "Scroll wallpaper" and verify xOffset values appear in Logcat
tag `WalloraEngine` (DEBUG build only).

**Crash fix — CancellationException swallowed in MultiSourcePagingSource**: Toggling a
category while wallpapers are loading makes `HomeViewModel.flatMapLatest` cancel the
in-flight paging coroutine. The `CancellationException` propagated into
`MultiSourcePagingSource.load()` where a blanket `catch (e: Exception)` silently swallowed
it, corrupting coroutine state and crashing the app. Fixed by adding `catch (e:
CancellationException) { throw e }` before the generic catch — the canonical structured-
concurrency rule: never swallow CancellationException.

**DTO Int→Long widening**: Several API fields were `Int` but real values exceed
`Int.MAX` (2,147,483,647). Confirmed: Pexels `photographer_id` = 2,151,143,420. Widened
`id`, `photographerId`, `totalResults` in `PexelsDtos.kt`; `views`, `favorites`, `total`
in `WallhavenDtos.kt`; `total` in `UnsplashDtos.kt`; `score`, `ups` in `RedditDtos.kt`.
Width/height/page fields stay `Int` (never overflow).

**Default categories = MINIMAL, AMOLED, NATURE**: User asked for "minimal, oled, amoled,
nature" as defaults. AMOLED (displayName "Dark/AMOLED") covers oled/amoled/dark — there is
no separate OLED entry. Changed `SettingsRepository.selectedCategories` fallback from
`emptySet()` to `DEFAULT_CATEGORIES`. Fallback only fires on fresh install (key absent);
subsequent toggles persist the explicit set.

**Splash screen — dark background + animated icon, no delay**: Changed
`windowSplashScreenBackground` from `#1565C0` to `#0E0E11` (near-black). Added
`splash_icon_anim.xml` (AnimatedVectorDrawable) targeting a new `icon_root` wrapper group
in `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`; plays a 400ms scale 0.88→1.0 + fade-in on entrance.
`windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration` = 400ms. Deliberately no
`setKeepOnScreenCondition` in `MainActivity` — the splash dismisses the instant the first
Compose frame is ready, so launch time is unchanged.

**IzzyOnDroid: dedicated release keystore via GitHub Secrets**: CI previously debug-signed
with an ephemeral keystore (regenerated per run) — IzzyOnDroid would reject updates as
"signature mismatch". Generated a 4096-bit RSA keystore at `~/.android/wallora-release.keystore`
(not committed). Added `build.gradle.kts` env-var fallback so CI can sign via
`SIGNING_KEYSTORE_B64` / `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD` / `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` secrets.
Workflow decodes keystore to `$RUNNER_TEMP` before build; graceful debug fallback if
secrets absent (forks). Fastlane metadata (`changelogs/1.txt`, screenshots, icon.png)
added under `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`. README IzzyOnDroid badge + install section
added; badge links go live after RFP accepted. RFP to be filed by the developer at
https://gitlab.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/-/issues.

## 2026-06-14 (round 2 — vibrant feed + Pixabay source)

**Fast-scroll duplicate-key crash**: Device crash log showed
`IllegalArgumentException: Key "UNSPLASH:IbpngRvnDzo" was already used` in
`LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`. Root cause: `MultiSourcePagingSource.load()` used
`distinctBy { it.globalKey }` which dedups within a single page load only. A wallpaper
re-appearing on a later page (or from a Room cache hit) produced two grid items sharing
the same key, crashing Compose's staggered-grid measure pass. Fixed by adding a
per-instance `seenKeys: MutableSet<String>` (synchronized) and replacing `distinctBy`
with `filter { seenKeys.add(it.globalKey) }`. The set persists across all `load()` calls
on the same PagingSource instance (which covers one full scroll session) and resets on
refresh when a new instance is created. Regression test added to `DedupTest.kt`.

**Vibrancy overhaul — Pixabay + category redesign**: User flagged the feed as "pale" after
comparing against Pinterest/Pixabay/Unsplash "mobile wallpaper" reference galleries.
Root cause: DEFAULT_CATEGORIES = {MINIMAL, AMOLED, NATURE} are the three muted/dark
categories; the empty-category fallbacks (Pexels getCurated, Unsplash order_by=popular)
pull editorial/desaturated content. Decisions:

1. **Added Pixabay as a 5th source** (`SourceId.PIXABAY`). Pixabay returns inherently
   saturated, wallpaper-friendly photos. API key as query param (no auth interceptor needed).
   Full Hilt multibinding + UserKeyCache + SettingsRepository key flow + SettingsViewModel
   sourceConfiguredMap wiring. isConfigured=false if key absent → silently excluded.

2. **Added three vibrant categories**: VIBRANT (colorful vibrant wallpaper), NEON (neon
   lights glow), GRADIENT (gradient colorful background). Each has queries for all five
   sources including Pixabay.

3. **Reordered Category.entries**: Vibrant categories (VIBRANT, ABSTRACT, NEON, GRADIENT,
   SPACE, AI_ART) lead the chip row. Topical categories (NATURE, LANDSCAPES, CITY, …)
   follow. MINIMAL and AMOLED moved to end — still selectable, just not dominant.

4. **Changed DEFAULT_CATEGORIES** from {MINIMAL, AMOLED, NATURE} to {VIBRANT, ABSTRACT,
   SPACE} — bold/colorful first impression on fresh install.

5. **Widened Wallhaven topRange** from 6M to 1y — more variety in top-rated content while
   still filtering for highest-quality wallpapers.

6. Deliberately NOT wiring `color=`/`colors=` single-hue filters: locking to one color
   kills the variety the user wants (they want "different types", not a single hue wall).

## 2026-06-14

**Per-source category distribution (variety fix)**: User reported that even with vibrant
categories, the feed looked monotonous — all images shared the same dark-background +
colorful-swirl aesthetic. Root cause: all selected categories were passed to EVERY source,
so all 5 sources converged on the highest-scoring "abstract fluid art" look. Fix: in
MultiSourcePagingSource, each source receives `categories[index % categories.size]` — one
category determined by its position. With NATURE/SPACE/CITY/ABSTRACT/ANIMALS as defaults,
round-robin interleave yields nature → space → city → abstract → animal images in sequence.
`buildCacheKey` updated to use per-source `effectiveCategories` so cache keys are
per-source-per-category (not shared). When categories is empty or a search query is active,
all sources fall through to the global categories (unchanged behavior).

**DEFAULT_CATEGORIES changed** from {VIBRANT, ABSTRACT, SPACE} (three similar-aesthetic
vibrant/abstract categories) to {NATURE, SPACE, CITY, ABSTRACT, ANIMALS} — five subjects
that are visually distinct from each other so each grid column shows a genuinely different
subject category, producing the Pinterest-style variety the user wanted.

**PIXABAY_API_KEY added to GitHub Actions secrets** (not committed to source). The release
workflow now writes all four API keys from secrets into local.properties before
assembleRelease, so the GitHub-released APK has all sources working out of the box. New
installs without any keys still work — sources are fail-soft when unconfigured.

## 2026-06-14 (round 3 — auto-changer + parallax fix)

**Auto-changer "does nothing" — root cause**: `setRotationEnabled(true)` only scheduled
`RotationWorker`, whose first run is ≥15 minutes (WorkManager minimum). Nothing visible happened
until WorkManager fired. Fix: `SettingsViewModel.setRotationEnabled` now calls
`nextWallpaperUseCase(HOME)` immediately after scheduling, giving instant feedback via snackbar.

**`isLiveWallpaperActive` was an orphaned DataStore flag**: `setLiveWallpaperActive(true)` had no
callers, so the flag was always `false`. `NextWallpaperUseCase` branched on it to decide
live-vs-static apply — permanently landing on static `setBitmap`, which would have deactivated
the live wallpaper on next rotation. Fixed by replacing the flag with a real runtime check:
`WallpaperManager.getInstance(context).wallpaperInfo?.packageName == context.packageName`. This
is the actual source of truth; no flag lifecycle to maintain. The DataStore key and getter/setter
were removed from `SettingsRepository`.

**Settings miscategorisation**: "On unlock" rotation lived under Rotation's Constraints section
but only works through the live wallpaper engine. Moved it to the Live wallpaper page. The Rotation
subtitle now reads "works without live mode"; the Live subtitle reads "optional — adds parallax
and on-unlock". Enabling rotation also updated its description to say it applies immediately.

**Parallax right-edge layering — root cause**: `CropCalculator.centerCropRect` produces a
*centered* destRect with the over-wide (1.3×W) bitmap split ±overflow/2 on each side. But
`ParallaxMath.translateX` previously panned the *full* overflow (0.3W) in a single direction:
at xOffset=1 it translated −0.3W, sliding the rect to expose the rightmost 15% of the surface
undrawn. And `renderOnCanvas` never cleared the canvas on the normal draw path — stale pixels
from the previous frame filled that strip, producing the "layered/broken on the right" artifact.

Fix A — **Symmetric pan**: `translateX = (0.5 − xOffset) × overflowPixels`. Range ±overflow/2,
matching the centered destRect. At every offset the drawn rect fully covers [0, surfaceW]. Unit
test added to assert this holds at every step in [0..1].

Fix B — **Canvas clear every frame**: `renderOnCanvas` now calls `canvas.drawColor(BLACK)` at
the top unconditionally, before drawing any bitmap. The early-return when bitmap is null was kept,
but the clear happens first in all cases. This also eliminates alpha bleed in crossfade.

`clampTranslateX` range updated to ±halfOverflow (was [−overflow, 0]).
`fixedOffsetTranslateX` simplified to return 0 (bitmap is already centred by destRect; 0 is
correct for the fixed-offset/parallax-disabled case).

## 2026-06-18 — new sources + Reddit OAuth + refresh fixes (v1.4)

**Four new wallpaper sources**: Added Openverse, NASA Image Library, Flickr, and Wikimedia Commons
as `WallpaperSource` implementations using the existing pluggable multibinding pattern.
- **Openverse** and **NASA** and **Wikimedia Commons** are keyless (`isConfigured = true`);
  all three have permissive licensing (Creative Commons / public domain / freely reusable).
- **Flickr** requires a free non-commercial API key (`FLICKR_API_KEY` in `local.properties` /
  BuildConfig); key passed as a query param (same pattern as Pixabay). CC+public-domain
  licences enforced via `license=4,5,6,9,10`; `safe_search=1` enforces SFW.
- Wikimedia Commons uses a descriptive `User-Agent` (policy requirement for bots).
- Each new source got DTO files, a Retrofit API interface, a source class, Hilt bindings, and
  a query field on every `Category` enum entry (17 categories × 4 sources). `SourceId` enum
  extended with `OPENVERSE`, `NASA`, `FLICKR`, `WIKIMEDIA`.

**Reddit → userless OAuth** (fix): Reddit's unauthenticated `.json` API returns HTTP 403 HTML
from clients without a logged-in session. Root cause: `JsonDecodingException: Expected '{' but
had '<'`. Fix: implemented `RedditAuthInterceptor` that fetches an application-only bearer token
via `grant_type=https://oauth.reddit.com/grants/installed_client` with `Basic clientId:""` auth
against `https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token`. Token is cached in-memory (refreshed 60s
before expiry); on 401 the cached token is invalidated and one automatic re-fetch is made. Reddit
Retrofit base URL changed from `reddit.com` to `oauth.reddit.com`. A stable `device_id` (UUID)
is generated once per install and persisted in DataStore. `RedditSource.isConfigured` now gates
on `effectiveRedditClientId` being non-blank (was always `true`). User can supply a client ID
via Settings → Sources → Reddit client ID field (or via `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` in `local.properties`).

**Visible source failures** (fix): `MultiSourcePagingSource.load()` previously returned an empty
`Page` even when all sources threw exceptions (silent blank screen). Fixed by tracking `anyThrew`
and `lastException`. If the deduplicated result list is empty AND at least one source threw, the
pager returns `LoadResult.Error(lastException!!)` so `HomeScreen` renders `ErrorState` with a
Retry button and the error message. Partial-success case unchanged: if some sources succeed and
others fail, partial results are returned (fail-soft; per-source failures don't blank the grid).

**Always-fresh refresh** (fix): Three sub-fixes:
1. `MultiSourcePagingSource.load()` now bypasses the Room TTL cache entirely when
   `params is LoadParams.Refresh` — network is always fetched on first load and pull-to-refresh;
   only `LoadParams.Append` (infinite scroll) consults cached rows.
2. `buildCacheKey` now appends a subreddit signature for Reddit (`":${subs.sorted().join("+")}")`)
   so changing the subreddit list never produces a cache hit against the old selection.
3. `HomeViewModel` `combine` now includes `settingsRepo.userSubreddits` as a third input (alongside
   `selectedCategories` and `enabledSources`) so any subreddit change triggers a new `Pager`
   instance and fresh load.

**Version bump**: `versionCode = 5`, `versionName = "1.4"`. Fastlane changelog added at
`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/5.txt`.

## 2026-07-05 — Vibrant feed engine + Settings redesign

**Problem**: the grid looked boring on every launch — adjacent tiles were the same subject
(each source was pinned to one category via `categories[index % size]`, then round-robin merged,
so positions `i` and `i+N` were same-source/same-category and landed adjacent in the masonry),
images skewed pale (Wallhaven `sorting=toplist` returned the same muted top set every time), and
the captured `colorHint` was never used. Custom keywords were also a dead feature (persisted and
shown but never passed to `browse()`).

**Feed diversifier** (`data/paging/FeedDiversifier.kt`, new): pure, unit-tested Kotlin (no
`android.graphics`) that reorders each page so neighbours differ in dominant colour (HSV hue from
`colorHint`), category and source. Greedy: pick the remaining item least similar to the last K=3
placed; tie-break by vibrancy (`sat*val`, a soft "prefer punchy" bias), then by stable index for
determinism. Runs in `MultiSourcePagingSource.load()` **after** `seenKeys` dedup (so the
LazyStaggeredGrid unique-key invariant is preserved) and carries a K-item `tail` across pages for
continuity. K=3 approximates 2–3 columns since the paging layer has no column count. `colorHint`
is present for Wallhaven/Pexels/Unsplash (the quality sources); other items spread by
category/source only. Chose NOT to add AndroidX Palette — bitmaps only exist post-Coil in the UI,
the wrong lifecycle for paging-time ordering.

**Topic rotation + custom keywords**: `MultiSourcePagingSource` now rotates each source's subject
by `(index + page + sessionOffset).mod(topics.size)` where topics = selected categories + custom
keywords (keywords queried via `source.search`). So a source cycles subjects as you scroll, and
the first screen differs across launches. `buildCacheKey` includes the keyword so keyword pages
don't collide with category pages. `HomeViewModel.combine` gained `customKeywords`, wiring the
previously-dead feature through `WallpaperRepository.browse`.

**Freshness** (`di/SessionSeed.kt`, new): a `@Singleton` holding a per-process seed from
`System.nanoTime()` (deliberately not persisted — a relaunch should reshuffle). Provides the
rotation `topicOffset` and a 6-char base36 `wallhavenSeed`. Wallhaven page 1 stays `sorting=toplist`
(high-quality first impression); deeper pages use `sorting=random&seed=<sessionSeed>` (fresh and
more saturated than toplist) — the primary fix for "same every launch" and "pale". `WallhavenApi`
gained a nullable `seed` query param.

**Keyless-first defaults**: `SettingsRepository` default enabled sources = the keyless four
(Wallhaven/Openverse/NASA/Wikimedia) ∪ any key-based source whose `BuildConfig` key is baked in
(so the CI release still lights up everything, self-builds work with zero keys). `SettingsViewModel`
auto-enables a source the first time its key is saved. Wallhaven is ordered first in
`WallpaperRepository` (the anchor). `DEFAULT_CATEGORIES` changed to
`{NATURE, SPACE, CITY, VIBRANT, ANIMALS, ABSTRACT}` for max subject+colour spread. These are
read-time fallbacks → fresh installs only; existing users keep their choices (no migration).

**Settings redesign**:
- Sources page split into "Ready to use" (keyless rows, on by default) and "Connect for more"
  (keyed `Card`s with connected/not-connected status, toggle, inline `ApiKeyField` + a
  "Get free key" link that opens the signup URL via `ACTION_VIEW`).
- Reddit subreddit selection moved from the Categories page onto the Reddit source card (shown
  only when Reddit is connected + enabled) — clean mental model: Sources = where images come from
  + per-source config; Categories = subjects.
- Categories page replaced the 17-chip wall with visual gradient `CategoryCard`s (per-category
  linear gradient from `ui/settings/components/CategoryVisuals.kt`) in a 2-column layout grouped
  into "Vibrant & Abstract / Nature & Places / Culture & Art / Minimal & Dark". Custom keywords
  became the "Your topics" section. Used chunked `Row`s (not `LazyVerticalGrid`) to avoid nested
  vertical scroll inside the page's scrolling Column.
- Hardcoded English literals in the Categories page moved to `strings.xml`.

**Tests**: `FeedDiversifierTest` (10 tests) exercises the real object — HSV conversion, circular
hue distance, size/set preservation, no-adjacent-same-category, hue-based separation, determinism,
`tail` continuity, trivial inputs, and the rotation formula's full coverage.
