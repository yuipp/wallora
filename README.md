# Wallora

**A minimal, Material You wallpaper app for Android — 100% free, no ads, no subscriptions, ever.**

Browse, search, and auto-rotate stunning wallpapers from Pexels, Wallhaven, Unsplash, and Reddit. Wallora is the only free app that ties all of this together: a live wallpaper engine with Material You colour extraction, gesture-based wallpaper swapping from any launcher, a Quick Settings tile, and a home-screen widget — features that are either missing from other apps or locked behind a paywall.

## Why Wallora?

| | What makes it different |
|---|---|
| **Free** | No ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases — and open source. |
| **Material You** | Sets wallpaper colours back into Android so your entire UI — system bars, widgets, apps — adapts instantly to every wallpaper change. |
| **Auto-rotation without opening the app** | Scheduled rotation via WorkManager, time-of-day alarms, and on-unlock triggers all run silently in the background. |
| **Change wallpaper from anywhere** | Launcher gesture, Quick Settings tile, home-screen widget, Tasker intent — no other free app exposes all four. |
| **Prefetch cache** | The next wallpaper is downloaded in the background immediately after each apply, so swapping feels instant. |

## Automatic wallpaper changing & Material You

Wallora runs a background rotation engine that changes your wallpaper on a schedule you control — no taps required. Every time a new wallpaper is applied:

1. The live wallpaper engine decodes the bitmap and calls `notifyColorsChanged()`.
2. Android extracts dominant colours from the bitmap and seeds the Material You palette.
3. Your system UI (status bar, nav bar), widgets, and supporting apps re-theme themselves automatically.

You set the interval (15 min → 24 h), pick a playlist or use the curated category feed, and Wallora does the rest.

## Change wallpaper without opening the app

This is where Wallora stands out from every other free wallpaper app. You can trigger "next wallpaper" from four different places — pick whichever fits your workflow:

### 1. Launcher gesture (Nova Launcher, Lawnchair, etc.)

| Launcher | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Nova Launcher** | Nova Settings → Gestures & inputs → pick a gesture (e.g. double-tap) → App shortcuts → Wallora → **Next wallpaper** |
| **Lawnchair** | Home screen settings → Gestures → choose gesture → App shortcuts → Wallora → **Next wallpaper** |
| **Any launcher** | Long-press the Wallora icon → **Next wallpaper** (static shortcut, works everywhere) |

After tapping, you'll see a brief "Changing wallpaper…" toast and the wallpaper updates in seconds (usually instant if prefetch already ran).

### 2. Quick Settings tile (no unlock needed)

1. Pull down the notification shade and tap the pencil / edit icon.
2. Find **Next wallpaper** in the tile list and drag it to your active tiles.
3. Tap the tile at any time — even from the lock screen — to swap wallpapers instantly.

This is unique to Wallora among free apps. No other free wallpaper app ships a functional Quick Settings tile.

### 3. Home-screen widget

Add the **Wallora widget** to your home screen. It shows the current wallpaper as a thumbnail. Tapping the **Next** button changes the wallpaper without opening the app.

### 4. Tasker / automation apps

Send an explicit intent to trigger the next wallpaper from any automation app (Tasker, MacroDroid, Automate, etc.):

```
Action:   com.wallora.app.action.NEXT_WALLPAPER
Package:  com.wallora.app
Class:    com.wallora.app.ui.NextWallpaperActivity
```

In Tasker: **Task → App → Send Intent** with the values above.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Android **12** (API 31) or higher
- JDK 17
- Android SDK with `platforms;android-35` and `build-tools;35.0.0`

### Install from IzzyOnDroid (recommended for auto-updates)

1. Install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) on your Android device.
2. In F-Droid, go to **Settings → Repositories → +** and add:
   ```
   https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo
   ```
3. Search for **Wallora** and install it — F-Droid will keep it up to date automatically.

> **Note:** The IzzyOnDroid listing goes live once the inclusion request is accepted. Until then, sideload the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/thissayantan/wallora/releases/latest).

### Quick build

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/.local/jdk17      # or wherever your JDK 17 lives
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Install on a connected device:

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Running tests

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

All unit tests are pure JVM / Robolectric — no device or emulator needed.

## API key setup

Wallora works **out of the box** with Wallhaven (SFW) and Reddit — no key required.

For higher-quality sources, copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` (already `.gitignore`d) and add your keys:

```properties
sdk.dir=/home/<you>/Android/Sdk

# Pexels — https://www.pexels.com/api/  (free)
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Unsplash — https://unsplash.com/developers  (free)
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here

# Wallhaven — https://wallhaven.cc/settings/account  (optional; unlocks NSFW filter)
WALLHAVEN_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Pixabay — https://pixabay.com/api/docs/  (free)
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Sources without a key are shown as **disabled** in Settings → Sources. They are still compiled in behind `isConfigured = false` and tested against committed JSON fixtures.

## Architecture

```
app/
  data/
    local/       Room: WallpaperEntity, FavoriteEntity, HistoryEntity, RecentSearchEntity
    remote/      Pexels · Wallhaven · Unsplash · Pixabay · Reddit  (Retrofit + kotlinx.serialization)
    paging/      MultiSourcePagingSource (round-robin fan-out + URL dedup)
    repository/  WallpaperRepository, SettingsRepository (DataStore Preferences)
    util/        SafeBitmapDecoder, ImageAdjustments
  domain/
    model/       Wallpaper, Category, SourceId, EditParams
    rotation/    RotationEngine (no-repeat window, playlist selection)
    usecase/     ApplyWallpaperUseCase, NextWallpaperUseCase (prefetch + candidate cache)
  ui/
    home/        HomeScreen + HomeViewModel (staggered grid, category chips)
    search/      SearchScreen + SearchViewModel (fan-out, recent searches)
    detail/      DetailScreen + DetailViewModel (full-res preview, actions)
    editor/      EditorScreen + EditorViewModel (adjustments, live preview)
    favorites/   FavoritesScreen + FavoritesViewModel
    history/     HistoryScreen + HistoryViewModel
    settings/    SettingsScreen + SettingsViewModel
    navigation/  WalloraNavGraph (typed sealed routes, bottom nav)
    theme/       WalloraTheme (dynamic colour, edge-to-edge)
  service/
    WalloraWallpaperService   Live wallpaper engine (parallax, crossfade)
    WalloraQsTileService      Quick Settings tile
    helpers/                  ParallaxMath, CrossfadeAnimator, CropCalculator
  widget/
    WalloraWidget             Glance app widget + NextWallpaperAction
  worker/
    RotationWorker            WorkManager periodic interval rotation
    AlarmScheduler            AlarmManager exact/inexact alarm scheduling
    BootReceiver              Re-registers alarms on BOOT_COMPLETED
```

**Key decisions:**
- Custom fan-out `PagingSource` (not `RemoteMediator`) for multi-source interleave
- Non-RenderScript blur: downscale → iterative box blur → upscale
- Parallax via over-wide bitmap (1.3×) + `onOffsetsChanged` translation
- `allowHardware(false)` in detail preview to sidestep GPU texture-size overflow on high-res images
- Baseline Profile deferred (requires device/managed emulator); see `DECISIONS.md`
